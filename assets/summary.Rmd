# Disability discussion in parliament 
How do politicians discuss disability issues? Has this changed over time? Are there any relationships between how disability issues are debated in Parliament and the policy decisions made by governments? In an attempt to answer these questions I downloaded everything that has ever been said in the House of Commons from 1936 to the present day. 

#### Data set
The ParlParse service, operated by Theyworkforyou.co.uk, records everything said in parliament from 1936 to the present day, allowing for 80 years of parliamentary debate and discussion to be analysed. The dataset includes 4,979,806 different speeches, of which 438,180 are included in this analysis, as they contain one or more of the disability phrases searched for.

#### Frequency of mentions of disability-relevant phrases

I grouped 23 different disability relevant phrases into 15 groups. I selected phrases that are likely to be only used in relation to disability issues. This means that words such as 'blind' or 'deaf' cannot be used, as they are frequently used in non-disability discussion; e.g. 'the member opposite is deaf to the concerns of ordinary people'. The number of each group of phrases were counted for each day of debate in parliament, and averaged over the year.


#### Sentiment analysis

In addition to the frequency of different words used in the Hansard, I wanted to see if there are any changes in the sentiment of disability discussion. I used the <a href="http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010" target="_blank">AFINN library by Finn Årup Nielsen</a> to assign a score from -5 (most negative) to +5 (most positive) to the words used in association with the different disability terms and phrases searched for in the Hansard.

The orange 'All Debate' line is the sentiment score for a random sample of 4% of all debate in Parliament. The sentiment of all debates was, until
